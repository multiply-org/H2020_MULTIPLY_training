The soil boundary is assumed to be Lambertian, and a combination of two soil spectra (typically one wet and one dry). Leaf optical properties are calculated with **PROSPECT D** (which you should already be familiar with).

    "\n",
    "* Parameters relating to particular pigments tend to have well defined spectral ranges where they have a large effect.\n",
    "* Structural parameters such as LAI, or ALA have an influence throughout the whole spectrum\n",
    "* Soil plays an important role. Even in high canopy cover areas, due to the high single scattering albedo of leaves in the NIR region, the soil signal is clearly present in the canopy reflectance.\n",
    "* Angles (sun and sensor acquisition geometry) play an important role in the measured reflectance.\n",
    "* Vegetation indices can be used to relate reflectance in a couple of bands to some parameters. However, when one explores the typical variation of the problem, one finds that their predictive power is limited and that other \"nuisance parameters\" reduce their ability to uniquely define the target variable\n",
    "* It is possible to train indices with an RT model for a reduced set of conditions, but in these cases, it may be more sensible to use other non-linear regression methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above comments suggest that going from canopy reflectance to a set of parameters (the so-called \"inverse problem\") is complicated. Effects resulting in a spectral overlap, added noise (either from the sensor, or from e.g. residual atmospheric corrections), and other confounding parameters, coupled with the limited spectral and temporal sampling make inversions hard.\n",
